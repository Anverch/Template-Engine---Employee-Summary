# Template Engine - Employee Summary

In this repository we built a software engineering team generator command line application. The application prompts the user for information about the team manager and then information about the team members. The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers and interns. This project generates a `team.html` page in the `output` directory. This assignment also passes all unit tests.
